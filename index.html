        Mental health issues and suicide rates have been increasing across society.
        Politics is more divided than ever, with Culture Wars now seen as a legitimate election strategy.
        Trust in the media is at rock bottom, with "fake news" increasingly indistinguishable from clickbaity headlines from traditional outlets.
        Science is derided and conspiracy theories abound.
        Inequality is rising and young people face a worse life than their parents for the first time in history.
        Some describe us as living in a "trauma culture", where we're surrounded by discord, anger and contention all the time. Loneliness among all age groups is on the rise and even young people are going out less, meeting fewer people, pairing up with partners less and having children less than ever before.
        Others talk about Enshittification to explain how we've created a system of incentives that leads to our digital lives being progressively worsened as our attention becomes commoditised and mined for advertising; the measurement of which is itself subject to massive ongoing fraud.
        All these problems are intertwined; they all have their roots in digital.
        In the way we think about the attention economy; the way we chase eyeballs with algorithmic personalisation of our messages, and the way we structure our campaigns, our companies and our laws; our incentives.
        We remember thinking of digital with hope.
        The Arab Spring was a time of optimism; people making genuine connections across physical boundaries to create shared dreams and change their worlds.
        Isolated individuals finding their communities online and escaping bullying and parochial attitudes to build their confidence and live their lives to the fullest.
        We are optimistic.
        We think digital can be a positive force for the world. It's still in its infancy; we're still learning.
        People still want to connect and form relationships and communities. People yearn for authenticity and the ability to trust.
        We think companies can be authentic and remain valued and valuable. That they can play a part in building authentic digital spaces. Most of all, that they can be powerful catalysts for change in the real world, bringing us all closer.
        We believe in authentic relationships built on trust.
        We are transparent with our clients and clear about objectives, progress and outcomes. We work with clients with open work cultures.
        We are honest with our partners and only insert ourselves into situations where we can bring value. We work with skilled individuals and companies, always spending the least necessary for an excellent outcome.
        We build destinations for users that are clear, engaging and truthful. We promote honest discussion with and between users, creating communities where expectations are upturned and positive outcomes become increasingly likely.
        The world has many problems. Digital has created or exacerbated many of these.
        We are driven by optimism. Digital is nothing if not changeable. We know digital. We can change things.
        Let's change things.
